  description: 'You hold the hammer out and feel it drawn to the lake of lava. You
    throw it in. Moments pass and you hear a rumble. Your race out and exit the volcano.
    Moments later, Heavy D emerges from the top with a hammer in hand. He is 12 stories
    tall and emanates radiation. He looks at you directly with a soul piercing gaze
    and speaks.


    "Thank you for freeing me and all of the Boyz. Without you
    this day would be lost, but there is hope once again. We shall stop Negativa
    D from summoning the Gobba Ghoul and save the world, all thanks to your cunning
    brain and valiant effort. Consider yourself a friend to Heavy D and the Boyz.
    Should you ever require our help, we will be there. Until then."


    With that
    he looks up at the sky and flys off. You look around and see all of the Boyz
    are following suit. You feel a great sense of relief. Negativa D will not win
    this day. You give yourself a moment to sit and appreciate what you were able
    to do for the world before it hits you "Wait, seriously, who the fuck is Franklin
    P. Perdue?"


    THE END'
