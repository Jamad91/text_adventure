  responses:
    notHoldingGivenItemResponse: My masks are one of a kind and very valuable. Some
      give you power, some transform you into another creature, some cause a moon
      to crash down onto the earth, it's a real grab bag. Point is, you better cough
      up something of value if you want one.
    beingGivenItemResponse: Yes...yes...this will do. Here is a mask of equal value.
      Good luck, traveler.
    isHoldingGivenItemResponse: You have what you came for. You will receive no more
      from me.
    doesNotWantItemResponse: Do not suggest such paltry offerings in exchange for
      my goods.
